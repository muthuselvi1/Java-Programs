In this substring problem ,I can solved in HackerRank.

Input Handling:

    The program utilizes the Scanner class to read input from the console.
    It reads an entire line as a string, which is the input from which a substring will be extracted.
    It then reads two integers that represent the start and end positions of the substring.

Substring Extraction:

    The program extracts the substring from the input string using the substring method provided by the String class.
    The substring is taken from the specified startIndex to the specified endIndex. However, note that the endIndex in substring is exclusive, meaning it does not include the character at that position.

Output:

    The program prints the extracted substring to the console.
